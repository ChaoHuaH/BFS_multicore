Two versions of implementation of BFS: serial and OpenMP
Reulst is the level of each node start from level 0


# Compile
make
make bfs_serial
make bfs_omp

# Execute
./EXEC input_file answer_file
./bfs_serial ../input/node10.in ../input/node10_root
./bfs_omp ../input/node10.in ../input/node10_root

# Content of inpute_file
first line: number of vertices
second line: numer of edges
following line: two number represent an edge
